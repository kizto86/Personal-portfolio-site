            | One of my driving force at work is the quote by Steven Johnson which says ,<em><strong>“If you look at history, innovation doesn't come just from giving people incentives; it comes from creating environments where their ideas can connect.</strong></em>
            <br>
            | I am a Software Engineer  who enjoys working in an innovate environment, team,  where I can  contribute my ideas and  experience , improve steadily my technical, personal and practical skills. 
            <br>
            | I am passionate about creating scalable products/solutions that do not only provide engaging, compelling and dynamic user experience but also improve and change the way users interact with application and companies interact with their customers/clients. 
            | I am both tech-driven and customer/user focused.
            <br>
            | Continual education to expand my knowledge in the area of software architectures, system integration  and programming, keeping up with the latest technology trends are both very important to me and working with technology in a team driven by innovation and customer/user focus gives me both personal and  professional fulfilment.
            <br>
            | When I am not sitting in front of  my laptop you can either find me jogging, reading a book, in the fitness center or just enjoying nature.
