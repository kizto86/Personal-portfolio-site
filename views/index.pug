        | This portfolio show case the projects, learning curve and knowledge gain during my JavaScript full stack tech degree programming certification at team tree house. Each project empowered me with new skills, problem to solve and an environment to put into practice the knowledge gained both in the area of frontend and backend development. This portfolio is also part of the projects done.
