# techdegree-project-6

Static Node.js and Express Personal Portfolio Site

This are some of the projects I built while completing the Team Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Program. Each project provided me a platform to put into practice the new skills acquired and improved my problem solve skills. This portfolio site is a project in itself.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the project files

### Prerequisites

In the command line, run:

```
npm init
```

to setup a package.json file

install express using:

```
npm install express --save
```

install pug using:

```
npm install pug --save
```

Optional
Nodemon is installed to automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected

```
npm install nodemon --save
```
