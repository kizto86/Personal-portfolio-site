# Static Node.js and Express Personal Portfolio Site

This are some of the projects I built while completing the Team Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Program. Each project provided me with a platform to put into practice the new skills acquired and improved my problem solving skill and technique. This portfolio site is a project in itself.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the project files

### Prerequisites

In the command line, run:

```
npm init
```

To setup a package.json file.

To install the packages run

```
 npm install

Optional
Nodemon is installed to automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected

```
npm install nodemon --save
```

font family,background color,font size for the p tag and color property were changed to make the interface more appealing.
